🌟 To-Do List App
This is a clean, modern, and aesthetic To-Do List application built using fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers a beautiful glassmorphism user interface on a serene background, providing a tranquil and focused environment for managing your tasks.

✨ Features
This application includes all the essential functionalities for a practical and attractive task manager:

🎨 Aesthetic & UX Features
Aesthetic Glassmorphism UI: The main container uses a semi-transparent background with a backdrop-filter: blur() effect, creating a modern, frosted-glass look.

Serene Background: A visually appealing background image is set to provide a pleasant and non-distracting work environment.

Responsive Design: Optimized for viewing on various screen sizes (though not explicitly coded for this, the flexbox layout is generally responsive).

Intuitive Animations: Subtle hover effects and transition times for buttons and list items enhance user feedback.

✅ Core Functionality
Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks using the input field and "Add Task" button (or by pressing Enter).

Edit Tasks: Tasks can be modified directly on the list:

Click the "Edit" button to make the task text editable.

The button changes to "Save" during the editing process.

Mark as Complete: Click directly on the task text to toggle its completion status.

Completed tasks display a line-through and a muted color for visual separation.

Note: Editing an incomplete task automatically removes the "completed" status.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks permanently using the dedicated "Delete" button next to each item.

🛠️ Technology Stack
HTML5: Semantic structure for the task list interface.
CSS3: Styling, including Flexbox for layout, CSS Gradients, and the advanced backdrop-filter property.
JavaScript: Handles all application logic (adding, editing, deleting, and toggling task status) without requiring external libraries or frameworks.
